Shoutout to fbessez and rtt for the Tinder API documentation

In the time it took me to write this, tinder changed it's endpoint hostname as well as the json nesting structure that returns user recommendation data for me. I wonder if it was coincidence or their own way of trying to rate limit me. Either way, I'll do more research into that.

To run:
1. pip install robobrowser requests bs4 config tinydb
2. python3 main.py
3. If you want to use python3 main.py s (silent mode) populate the config file with your user credentials
